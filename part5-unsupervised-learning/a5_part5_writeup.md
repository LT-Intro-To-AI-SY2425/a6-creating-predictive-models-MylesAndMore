# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

middle - typical (average income, average spending)
top left - idiots (below average income but above average spending?? what are you thinking?)
bottom left - penny pinchers by design (below average income and below average spending)
bottom right - penny pinchers by choice/my dad (above average income and belove average spending)
top right - stereotypical rich people, also probably idiots (above average income and above average spending)

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

Probably the bottom right cluster (cluser four), aka the "my dad" group.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

The marketing team could choose to approach the middle group with small upsales, as they likely have a bit more money to spend and aren't going all out, so they could try to talk them into small upgrades (like heated seats and the like).
