# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

My R^2 was equal to 0.63, which suggests the model does not exhibit very strong correlation with the data.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?

My predicted value is 36.52.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think that with an R^2 of 0.63, the model is only somewhat accurate. From real-world experience (physics labs and the like), I know that an R^2 this low is probably not accurate enough to be reliable for anything more than a rough estimate. More data could help alleviate this.
